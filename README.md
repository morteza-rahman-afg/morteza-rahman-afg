# Hi! I'm Morteza 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **front-end developer** with a deep passion for learning and building. Since the beginning of my journey, I've been consistently working on various projects using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to strengthen my skills through hands-on experience.

Currently, my main focus is on mastering the **React** library and the **Tailwind CSS** framework. I dedicate time daily to improving my knowledge and staying up to date with front-end development best practices.

For over **two years**, I’ve been learning front-end development continuously through courses, tutorials, and practical projects. These self-initiated projects have played a key role in helping me understand complex concepts and grow technically.
